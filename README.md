BizQuiz was created for the FBLA Mobile Application Development event.

The naviagation of BizQuiz is fairly simply, consisting of silver buttons on a blue background to answer questions, choose your topic, and get to the topics.

The sourcing and lincensing for the questions for each of the topics is providided on the pop up at the beginning, but here's it anyways:
This app was made as a part of the Mobile Application Development FBLA-PBL competitive event.

The information for the Basic Parliamentary Procedure Questions and Answers were based off the FBLA bylaws, the Introduction to Parliamentary Procedure Questions and Answers, the Parliamentary Procedure Questions and Answers, along with other Basic Parliamentary Procedure materials provided by our local chapter. 
The information for the topic of national office was based off of the bylaws at https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla/bylaws#qualifications, and the fbla pbl page on national officer candidates at https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla/officers/candidates/
The information for the topic of Business Skills was sourced from the sample practice questions for the Introduction to Business, Business Law, Business Communications, Introduction to Business Communications, and Introduction to Business Procedures. These questions are copyrighted to FBLA and therefore not my property, and are intended for the individual use of FBLA members studying for their events. Along with this, there was information provided on the website https://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/business-advice/starting-your-business/business-skills that was used in the making of these questions. 
The information used in the making of the questions for the Competitive Event topic were provided on the national FBLA-PBl website at https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla/competitive-events/ and on the links providing within that page.
	C. Code
For the popup that shows the user whether they were correct or incorrect in their answer was taken from an open source repository on github, by relatedcode, called ProgressHUD. That code was developed by them, however the rest of the code used in the development of BizQuiz was created by me, mixed with some code made by apple (Ex. the alert popup) and configured by me. Along with this, some pieces were advised by StackOverflow, and a variety of tutorials, and changed to suit this app.
	D.Terms
